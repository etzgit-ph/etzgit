  Description: "Ensure that all critical failures in the `ExecutorService` (rollback failure, protected path errors) are logged at the `critical` level with full error context."
  Implementation_Details:
    Action: "Modify `apps/api/src/agent/executor/executor.service.ts`. Update the catch blocks for security exceptions and test failures to log the event using the injected `LoggerService` at the `critical` level, including the full stack trace and error object (using Winston's structured logging capabilities)."

  Implementation_Details:
    Action: "Modify `production.yml` and `staging.yml`. After `terraform apply`, add a step that uses the shared utility (134) to parse the Terraform output. Ensure the sensitive `db_connection_string` is immediately stored in a GitHub Actions mask command (`echo '::add-mask::...'`) before being passed as an environment variable to the application container."
