    Action: "Modify 'apps/api/src/common/interceptors/security-headers.interceptor.ts'. Add a strict CSP header value to the response. Since the API is not serving UI, the policy should be focused on preventing external script/object loading (e.g., `default-src 'self'`)."

  Validation_Criteria:
    - Type: "Functional_Check"
      Description: "Verify the response includes the Content-Security-Policy header."
      Instructions: "Inspect the response headers for the presence and value of the CSP."
  Security_Controls:
    - Control: "Defense-in-Depth (CSP)"
      Description: "Mitigates injection attacks (like XSS) if an attacker somehow gains control of the API response body, even if the primary purpose is not serving HTML."
      Verification: "Check the interceptor for the detailed CSP string."
  Rationale: "Defense-in-depth principle. Security headers must be robustly configured on all HTTP services."
