# ADR 0003: Secure Human-in-the-Loop Approval and Automated Deployment

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure secure, auditable, and automated upgrades to the codebase using AI-generated proposals, we implemented a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) approval workflow. This workflow enforces:
- Secure file writing with path validation and protected path enforcement
- Atomic commit, branch, and push operations
- Automated pull request creation via GitHub API
- CI/CD validation for AI-generated branches
- Frontend feedback for proposal approval and PR creation

## Decision
- All AI-generated proposals must be approved by a human operator before being committed and pushed.
- The backend enforces path validation, protected path restrictions, and secret scanning before any file write.
- Upon approval, the system atomically writes files, commits changes, pushes a new branch, and creates a GitHub PR.
- CI/CD workflows validate all AI-generated branches before merge.
- The frontend provides clear feedback and links to the created PR/branch.

## Consequences
- Ensures auditability and traceability of all AI-generated changes
- Prevents unauthorized or unsafe modifications to protected files
- Enables rapid, secure upgrades with human oversight
- Supports compliance and governance requirements
