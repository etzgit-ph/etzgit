# Contributing to etzgit

## Pull Request Workflow
- All changes (human or agent) must be submitted via Pull Request (PR).
- Every PR requires at least one approval and must pass all status checks before merging.
- No direct pushes to `main` are allowed.

## Code Reviews
- Reviewers must verify code quality, security, and compliance.
- Use the provided linting and test tools before approving.

## Overriding/Disabling the Agent
- If the autonomous agent must be paused or overridden, document the reason in the PR and notify the maintainers.
